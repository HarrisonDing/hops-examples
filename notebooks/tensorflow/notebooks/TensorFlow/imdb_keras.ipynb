    "Two-class classification, or binary classification, may be the most widely applied kind of machine learning problem. In this example, we will learn to classify movie reviews into \"positive\" reviews and \"negative\" reviews, just based on the text content of the reviews using **LSTMs**.\n",

    "## The IMDB dataset\n",
    "We'll be working with \"IMDB dataset\", a set of 50,000 highly-polarized reviews from the Internet Movie Database. They are split into 25,000 reviews for training and 25,000 reviews for testing, each set consisting in 50% negative and 50% positive reviews.\n",
    "Just like the MNIST dataset, the IMDB dataset comes packaged with Keras. It has already been preprocessed: the reviews (sequences of words) have been turned into sequences of integers, where each integer stands for a specific word in a dictionary.\n",
